          <h3>
            In a life filled with creativity, love, and unwavering dedication,
            our beloved dad, Ronald Arthur Huston, left an indelible mark on all
            who knew him. Born on September 10th, 1954, in Alexandria, Virginia,
            he embarked on a journey that showcased the essence of his
            character.<br /><br />At just 17, he fearlessly joined the United
            States Army, serving his country with honor until the age of 19. In
            1980, fate led him to a first date with the love of his life, Lisa
            Henningsen, and their bond grew into a timeless love story.
            Together, they welcomed the joys of parenthood, raising their four
            children the best they could. An incredibly hardworking man, Ronald
            embraced the role of provider wholeheartedly, working long hours to
            ensure his family's happiness and comfort. In 2002, he became a
            devoted stay-at-home dad, and with his boundless talents, he founded
            "The Restoration Wizard", a carpet cleaning business. Ronald's
            creative spirit shone through his passion for woodworking,
            chime-making, and restoring old cars. Throughout his life, Ronald's
            heart overflowed with love and compassion. He adopted numerous dogs
            throughout his lifetime, all whose presence brought immense joy and
            comfort to him. In 2016, he found solace in faith, accepting Jesus
            Christ as his Lord and Savior, and on February 14th of that same
            year, he took a momentous step in his spiritual journey as he was
            baptized.

            <br /><br />Surrounded by his adoring family members, Ronald's
            journey on this earth reached its conclusion on June 25th, 2023, at
            the age of 68. His legacy of love, resilience, and creative spirit
            lives on in the cherished memories he leaves behind. As we bid
            farewell to this extraordinary man, we find comfort in the knowledge
            that his love and influence will forever resonate in our hearts.
            Rest in peace, dear dad, knowing that your impact on our lives will
            never fade.
